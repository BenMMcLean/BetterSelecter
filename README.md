Demo: http://arctro.com/open/BetterSelecter/

BetterSelecter allows you to easily implement a clean, easy to use, and searchable select form. It will turn a standard selector such as:

```html

<select>
  <option>Op 1</option>
  <option>Op 2</option>
  <option>Op 3</option>
  ...
 </select>

 ```

 into this:

 ![selector](https://i.imgur.com/gV7HO5L.png)

 and

 ![search selector](https://i.imgur.com/2274uSH.png)

 Simply import jQuery, Better Select and it's stylesheet and create a standard selector element. To activate call:

 ```javascript

 $("selector").betterSelect();

 ```
